# VahakWikiAssignment

Build an iOS or Android Application using  Flutter / React Native / Android / Cordova / Phonegap / Xamarin, etc,  that calls the Wikipedia API  to show a list of search results. The link contains sample API requests and an API sandbox environment to test it out. (For example, click this to see what a sample request/response looks like.)

   - Parse JSON from the API response.
   - Each list item should display appropriate data from the API. Show whichever fields you think are necessary.
   - Clicking a list item launches the respective Wikipedia page.
   - The UI specification is left to you. Build the UX and use appropriate UI widgets to give the best experience as you see fit for a Wiki search application.
   - Cache responses to give a good offline experience.
   - Display description with image and title. All these 3 things are very important to display in the list.
